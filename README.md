<h4>My name is Paige Smith, a full stack web developer. I have experience working with HTML html, CSS, and JavaScript. I really excel as a web developer through my creativity, detail-oriented mindset, and efficiency. I am very comfortable creating websites using the online coding libraries: Bootstrap by Twitter and jQuery. I find these libraries extremely helpful in my development of a website. They allow for me to focus most on the needs and wants of the clients by being able to add pre-coded components into the clientâ€™s website without wasting time debugging this component for hours before I even start working on the other keys aspects of the website, such as design, functionality, and anything else the client finds important. I love creating and designing websites. I love using my skills as a creative person to create something so useful and practical for anyone. I would bring an upbeat positive energy full of ideas and innovative coding to any company. </h4>
